All 386 pokémon in the palm of your hand!

This is a TI-83+ pokédex I made back in 2005. By now, nobody really knows how
it works. It should compile somehow and run on some version of the TI-83+
firmware. No guarantees.
It may take two tries to launch it properly once it's in the device.


If you do get it to run, here's a small manual:

In this app, you don't have to press modifiers before keys. For example, the
"9" key will act as "9" or "Q" depending on the situation. You can use the
"MODE" key as "QUIT" without pressing "2ND" first.

On the landing page, press UP. (The "help" option doesn't work.) This will get
you to the [select] page. Press ENTER to go to Abra's page.

Once you do this, the app is unlocked and all the global keys will work:

** global keys **

The blue keys just below the screen switch modes:
    Y=     [poké] (press again for [item/ability], and again to go back)
    WINDOW [move]
    ZOOM   [select]
    TRACE  [move list]
    GRAPH  [stat calculator]

MODE will quit the app (the key has a Quit label in yellow, but there's no need
to press 2ND to get this functionality)


** [poké] screen **

Shows the currently selected monster. On the first line we have its name
and numbers in several numbering schemes (H=Hoenn, J=Johto, N=National).
The second line shows the type(s), male(^)/female(+) ratio, and size in meters.
Third line: base HP (+effort yield if any), breeding group IDs, weight in kg
Fourth line: base Attack (+eff yield), color, XP to level 100
Fifth: base Defense (+eff yield), evolution info
Sixth: base Speed (+eff yield), capture rate
Seventh: base Sp.Atk (+eff yield), base friendliness
Eighth: base Sp.Def (+eff yield), egg hatching speed
The last two lines show available abilities.
There's a crude picture to the right side of the screen.

UP and DOWN scroll through the 'dex.
Letter keys recall entries you have stored on the [select] screen.
Pressing Y= again will show the [item/ability] screen.
ENTER will go to [select]


** [item/ability] screen **

Shows the available items in various versions (there are either two slots,
common and rare, separated by /, or a single "100%" slot).
The bottom half of the screen provides some detail on available abilities.

Keys do the same as on the [poké] screen, except Y= returns to [poké].


** [move] screen **

Shows info about the currently selected move. (Note that the current index is
shared between [poké] and [move]; scrolling through one will affect the other)

First line has the name, number, [P]hysical/[S]pecial, and type.
(Note: physical/special is based on the type. This is gen. III.)
PP is displayed in a little box thingy, along with how much more a PP UP gives.

Left side of screen:
    PoWeR, ACCuracy, SPeeD rank
    Target (useful for 2v2 battles)
    Flags: CONTact, brightPoWDeR, king's ROCK, SouND
    and three other flags named C4, C5, C6

Right side of screen has the effect chance (in %), effect number, and even an
attempt at a description of the effect.

The bottom of the screen houses Contest info: Appeal, Jam, type and effect

The UP and DOWN keys scroll, letter keys recall moves stored on the [select]
screen, ENTER will go to [select].


** [select] screen **

Use the letter keys (the ones with the green A-Z, no need to press ALPHA before
the key) to input a name of a monster or move. Then, press ENTER to go to its
page. DEL acts as backspace. CLEARS clears your input and shows the initial
help.
UP and DOWN scroll through the list.

You can also use special sequences with "Θ" (the 3 key) to select by number:
NΘ123 will go to #123 in National Dex (Scyther)
JΘ123 will go to #123 in Johto Dex (Snubbul)
And similarly for HΘ (Hoenn), GΘ (GBA internal), XΘ (TI-83-dex internal),
MΘ (move number). If in doubt t's all there on the initial screen.

Press the "X,T,Θ,n" key followed by a letter to "store" the currently selected
item for quick access later. (Note that the app doesn't remember if you stored
a pokémon or a move. It will just assign the index.)


** [move list] screen **

Shows learnable moves of the currently selected monster.

There are four tabs here: Level-up, Tutors, Machine, Breed. The currently
selected one is spelled out in the second line. Just before that, the others'
initial letters appear. These correspond to the ALPHA, X,T,Θ,n and STAT keys.
Press the corresponding key to switch tabs.

The UP and DOWN keys select moves from the list; ENTER wil take you to the
selected move.
LEFT and RIGHT switch pages in case there are more moves that can fit;
a little scrollbar/page info is shown at the top of the screen.
Letter keys load a pokémon stored on the [select] screen.

The DEL key switches to a different pokémon. I don't know how this different
pokémon is selected.

** [stat calculator] screen **

A stat calculator for the currently selected pokémon.

Use the arrow keys to navigate, and the number keys to enter numbers in the
DV and EL columns.
In the P column, use plus/minus to select a nature, or scroll to the Nature row
and use letter keys and arrows.
The resulting stat appears to the right.
You can also enter the level.
